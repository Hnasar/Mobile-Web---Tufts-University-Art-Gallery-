Unfixable bugs
-Filtering large list of artwork freezes phones
  ~remedied by removeing filter from large list
  ~references a jquery function, and we can't add custom functions without directly modifying the jquery mobile code
-Home button doesn't appear in the title bar under Browse By > Artist (or any of the other options)
  ~The way we have nested listviews means that we can't manually add things to the header


Not fixed bugs
-When going Browse By > Artist > Artist's Work > SOME_ARTWORK, then clicking back makes the back button 
disappear from the artist's work page.
-Footer toolbar doesn't appear under Browse By > Artist (or any of the other options)
-Refreshing a page that is not the home page removes the back button
-Home page title image gets cut off when in portrait
-Footer/Header stay in-view in some pages but not others (does not stay in-view on an artwork page)


Still Todo
-Create Info page on the footer toolbar
-Create About page on home page
-Finish loading actual tour info from a database


Nice To Have
-Make it so clicking on a footer toolbar item doesn't slide to animate
-Have mini static google map image under each Artwork, or a link to an actual map with the artwork
-Have image-slideshow on the home page
-Center image of artwork and add a dropshadow (perhaps both can be done w/ css3?)
-Place information on artwork in a sort of white box to stand out from the gray background
