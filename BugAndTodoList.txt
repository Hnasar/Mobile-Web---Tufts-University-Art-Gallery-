Unfixable bugs
-Filtering large list of artwork freezes phones....remedied by removeing filter from large list

Not fixed bugs
-When going Browse By > Artist > Artist's Work > SOME_ARTWORK, then clicking back makes the back button 
disappear from the artist's work page.
-Home button doesn't appear in the title bar under Browse By > Artist (or any of the other options)
-Footer toolbar doesn't appear under Browse By > Artist (or any of the other options)
-Refreshing a page that is not the home page removes the back button
-Home page title image gets cut off when in portrait

Still Todo
-Have mini static google map image under each Artwork, or a link to an actual map with the artwork
-Make it so clicking on a footer toolbar item doesn't slide to animate
-Create Info page on the footer toolbar
-Create About page on home page
-Create Exhibits page on the home page
-Link Guided Tours to the same place as the footer toolbar tours button
-Remove Podcasts link from homepage (or link it to some podcasts page)
-Have image-slideshow on the home page (right now it's kind of boring)
-Finish loading actual tour info from a database
